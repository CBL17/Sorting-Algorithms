# Sorting Algorithms

This is my personal repository for sorting algorithms that I've implemented in C.

This repository will grow and change as my knowledge of C does the same, but I hope this to be a fun side project to supplement my studies.

## Currently Implemented

 * Insertion Sort
 * Selection Sort
 * Bubble Sort (a personal favorite)
